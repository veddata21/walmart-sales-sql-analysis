📝 Executive Summary

This project presents a structured analysis of retail customer data from a Walmart-style multi-city retail chain using advanced SQL techniques. The goal was to extract actionable business insights to support strategic decision-making for marketing, operations, and customer engagement.

🔍 Key Objectives:
- Identify top customers and high-revenue age segments  
- Segment customer behavior by age, gender, and city  
- Measure repeat purchases and loyalty indicators  
- Use SQL CTEs and window functions to answer business questions

📊 Dataset Overview:
- Total transactions analyzed: 10,000+  
- Unique customers: 5,000+  
- Cities: 3 (A, B, C)  
- Columns: Age, Gender, City Category, Purchase Amount, Product Category

💡 Business Insights:
- Age groups **36–50** contributed the **highest revenue** overall  
- **Top 5 customers** spent nearly **3x more than the average customer**  
- **City B** had the highest total orders; **City C** had the highest average order value  
- **Male customers** placed more orders, but **spending patterns were similar** across genders  
- Several users were identified as **repeat buyers (3+ orders)** using `ROW_NUMBER()`  
- Advanced SQL techniques such as `CTEs`, `RANK()`, `SUM OVER`, and `CASE` were used to segment and interpret data

🧠 Skills Demonstrated:
- Structured data analysis using **MySQL**
- Business segmentation logic using **CASE WHEN**
- KPI derivation using **window functions**
- Clean code commenting and query documentation
- GitHub-based project organization

📦 Project Outcome:
This project delivers a complete SQL-based business analysis portfolio piece demonstrating real-world skills relevant to Business Analyst roles at MNCs, consulting firms, and data-driven startups.
